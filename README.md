# phishing detection using Ml algorithms
Phishing is a very unique type of problem, in that its format and protocol is difficult to predict. One might be able to manually recognize a few hundred emails and decide whether they are spam or not. 
Machine Learning algorithms can take a huge amount of data as input, preprocess and clean it, look for patterns and connections in the data and give out an informed decision.They are effective at handling large-scale problems.This is extremely helpful given the nature of phishing attacks and the pressing need for an efficient cyber security system to detect and predict real time attacks. 

Support Vector Machines Model:
The support vector machines model has an accuracy of 0.96, which is higher than the logistic regression and decision trees models. The model has a precision of 0.96, which means that 96% of the predicted phishing URLs were actually phishing URLs. The recall score of 0.97 indicates that the model identified 97% of the actual phishing URLs as phishing URLs. The F1-score of 0.96 is slightly lower than the decision trees model but higher than the logistic regression model. Overall, the support vector machines model performs well and is more accurate than the logistic regression model but less accurate than the random forest model.

Logistic Regression Model:
The logistic regression model has an accuracy of 0.93, which is reasonable but not as high as the other models. The model has a precision of 0.93, which means that 93% of the predicted phishing URLs were actually phishing URLs. The recall score of 0.93 indicates that the model identified 93% of the actual phishing URLs as phishing URLs. The F1-score of 0.93 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Overall, the logistic regression model performs reasonably well, but there is scope for improvement.

Decision Trees Model:
The decision trees model has an accuracy of 0.97, which is higher than the logistic regression model. The model has a precision of 0.96, which means that 96% of the predicted phishing URLs were actually phishing URLs. The recall score of 0.97 indicates that the model identified 97% of the actual phishing URLs as phishing URLs. The F1-score of 0.97 is higher than the logistic regression model. Overall, the decision trees model performs well and is more accurate than the logistic regression model.
